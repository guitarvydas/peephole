# Overview
To me, "assembler" is anything that is parseable by Ohm-JS.

"Assembler" used to mean anything that was parseable by clunky, hand-build parsers written in machine code.

Now we have better tools.

Syntax is cheap.

# Goal
Showcase of what is possible with Ohm-JS, and, OCG-thinking, and, lessons from working with Assembler.

1. Generating boiler-plate JS, then, rewriting the boiler-plate JS to be more JS-y, using GCC-style peephole optimization.

2. Using Ohm-JS as a gaming-language-assembler that creates JSON.  Based on Ghost-Stars source code (game-jam entry).

Goal: attempt to use Descript to create an introductory video about these ideas showing source code.

Future: show how to apply these ideas to parsing diagrams (DaS) and generating code.
